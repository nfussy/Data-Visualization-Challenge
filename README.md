# Data-Visualization-Challenge

Collaboration with others: I worked with Hunter Becker and Connor Dekok when it came to comparing results of the code and sharing portions of the code to complete portions of the project. During our sessions, we would talk each other through the various issues we encountered.

Much of the code was generated from the in-class work. Some other sites I used:

Analysis:
In this analysis, we ran tests on a multitude of potential SCC Drug Regimens. The main purpose was to test the efficacy of the drug of interest, Capomulin. After cleaning the data down to 4 treatments, we made a box plot that highlights their results. It would appear that both Capomulin and Ramicane lead to a much smaller increase in size of the tumor volume. Ramicane had the lowest mean tumor volume of 40.21 mm3. The demograaphic breakdown of the mice shows that there was a slightly larger, but rather insignificant, amount of males in comparison to the females. There also appears to be a solid correlation between the weight of the mice (g) and the average tumor volume - 0.84, with a regression R-squared value of 0.708...
